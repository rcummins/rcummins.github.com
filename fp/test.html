            Welcome to Harvard XC Tracker. <br />
            <br />
            The goal of this website is to provide members of the Harvard
            Women's Cross Country Team with a better way to make comparisions
            between the different races they run than is provided by Harvard's
            sports website, 
            <a href="http://www.gocrimson.com">gocrimson.com</a>. 
            There, cross country meet results are organized by meet, which 
            allows runners to see how they stacked up against their competitors
            on that given day, but makes any other type of comparison 
            difficult. As a runner, I like to be able to compare my 
            performances throughout my career, which used to involve going
            through each separate page of results for every meet I ran in. 
            This website facilitates that process.
